**Abstract:** 3-D exoplanet climate models are increasingly used to gain a comprehensive understanding of planetary atmospheres and estimate the various climate conditions of other planets with different planetary parameters of spin-orbit configurations, surface properties, and atmospheric compositions. However, 3-D exoplanet climate models are computationally expensive, with typical simulations costing thousands of core-hours to reach equilibrium states after integrations of hundreds of model years, making it impractical to fully sample the planetary parameters. In this study, we evaluate two extrapolation techniques to estimate the equilibrium state through short nonequilibrium simulations from ROCKE-3D (Resolving Orbital and Climate Keys of Earth and Extraterrestrial Environments with Dynamics), a 3-D Global Circulation Model (GCM) developed at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) for the modeling of climates of solar system and exoplanetary terrestrial planets. Based on 70 equilibrium ROCKE-3D simulations with various obliquities between 0° and 90° and rotation periods between 1–128 days, the conventional extrapolation technique, the Gregory method, reproduces the equilibrium global temperature in 57 out of 70 simulations within 1 degree through linear extrapolation of surface temperature changes with reference to net radiation changes of the first 50 model-years. However, the Gregory method fails to reproduce the equilibrium global temperature in the remaining 13 simulations with slow feedbacks involving the sea ice changes over the polar regions. On the other hand, the Multi-Component Linear Regression (MC-LR) method, an extension of the Gregory method based on extrapolation of both fast and slow feedbacks, shows potential to accurately estimate the equilibrium temperature of the remaining 13 simulations.

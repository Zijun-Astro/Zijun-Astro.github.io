Zijun He is a high school student from Madison, Wisconsin with academic interests in physics and astronomy. He is currently learning about the science of astronomy and is utilizing Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo (MCMC) Simulations to probe the characteristics of exoplanets.

In addition to the exoplanetary works, he has participated in research and engineering-focused programs including NASA Student Launch, where he contributed to projects involving rocket design, payload development, and data analysis. 

Zijun has also conducted research through academic programs such as the Hubert Mack Thaxton Research Fellowship where he utilized MCMC fitting techniques to learn more about the masses of the b and c planets in the TOI-4468 System. Furthermore, he has used transit timing variation (TTV) analysis of exoplanetary systems to learn more about TOI-1130 and TOI-4468. He has used tools such as Python, Jupyter Notebook, and MCMC methods in support of these projects.

Zijun was also selected as 1 of 150 students for the NASA STEM Enhancement in Earth Science internship, hosted by the Center for Space Research at the University of Austin Texas. He is working with seven other students on understanding exoplanet transits in greater depth.

He plans to pursue a degree in astrophysics or physics and continuing to be a researcher in the field of astronomy. He hopes to eventually teach students the wonders of astronomy.

I am a high school student from Madison, Wisconsin with academic interests in astronomy and astrophysics. I'm currently using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations to study the characteristics of exoplanets and has conducted transit timing variation (TTV) analyses of systems such as TOI-1130 and TOI-4468.

In 2024, I was given the opportunity to work with Alyssa Jankowski and Professor Juliette Becker through the Hubert Mack Thaxton Research Fellowship. This internship was my first experience in real scientific research and I learned a lot through Alyssa's mentorship and Professor Becker's advice. I also participate in engineering-focused initiatives such as NASA Student Launch, where I contributed to rocket design, payload development, and data analysis.

In 2025, I was selected for the NASA STEM Enhancement in Earth Sciences (SEES) internship, where I will collaborate with a research team to study exoplanet transits in greater detail. I plan to pursue a degree in astrophysics or astronomy, with the goal of continuing research and teaching students the passion I felt for astronomy!

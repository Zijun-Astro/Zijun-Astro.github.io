Zijun He is a high school student from Madison, Wisconsin with academic interests in physics and astronomy. He is currently using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations to study the characteristics of exoplanets and has conducted transit timing variation (TTV) analyses of systems such as TOI-1130 and TOI-4468.

Through the Hubert Mack Thaxton Research Fellowship and other academic programs, he has used tools like Python and Jupyter Notebook to explore exoplanet masses and orbital dynamics. He also participates in engineering-focused initiatives such as NASA Student Launch, where he contributes to rocket design, payload development, and data analysis.

In 2025, Zijun was selected for the NASA STEM Enhancement in Earth Sciences (SEES) internship, where he is collaborating with a research team to study exoplanet transits in greater detail. He plans to pursue a degree in astrophysics or physics, with the goal of continuing research and teaching in the field of astronomy.

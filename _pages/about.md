I am a high school student from Madison, Wisconsin with academic interests in astronomy and astrophysics. I'm currently using Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo (MCMC) simulations to study the characteristics of exoplanets and has conducted transit timing variation (TTV) analyses of systems such as TOI-1130 and TOI-4468.

I was given the opportunity to work with [Alyssa Jankowski](https://alyssajankowski.carrd.co/#) and Professor [Juliette Becker](https://beckergroup.wiscweb.wisc.edu/) through the [Hubert Mack Thaxton Research Fellowship]([https://www.instagram.com/p/DKvlhgYNa64/]) as a 2025 Thaxton Fellow, where I worked on the TOI-4468 system and extrapolated the masses of the 2 planets (b and c) that resided within. In 2025, I was given the opportunity to intern with NASA through the [NASA STEM Enhancement in Earth Sciences (SEES)](https://www.csr.utexas.edu/education-outreach/high-school-internships/sees/) internship, where I will collaborate with a research team to study exoplanet transits. 

I also participate in engineering-focused initiatives such as [NASA Student Launch](https://www.nasa.gov/learning-resources/nasa-student-launch/), where I contributed to rocket design, payload development, and data analysis on the SLOSH mechanics of baffles within the "fuel tanks" of a rocket. Furthermore, I love to teach children and teens of all ages astronomy through Madison School & Community Recreation (MSCR) program.

I plan to pursue a degree in astrophysics or astronomy, with the goal of continuing research and teaching students the passion I felt for astronomy!

Ultra-short-period (USP) planets are a rare but dynamically significant subset of the exoplanet sample, and understanding their dynamical histories and migration processes is necessary to build a complete picture of the outcomes of planet formation. In this work, we present an analysis of system age constraints and the impact of tidal evolution in the TOI-1937A system, a component of a large-separation stellar binary with an ambiguous age constraint that hosts a massive (>2 M₍Jup₎) USP planetary companion. Through a suite of tidal evolution simulations and analysis of the transit timing variations present in the photometric data, we find that the ultra-hot Jupiter TOI-1937Ab is likely undergoing orbital decay driven by tidal interactions, and we place an observational upper limit on its decay rate of ｜Ṗ｜ < 0.09 s yr⁻¹. We consider three different hypotheses for the system age based on three distinct methods of age estimation. These three age limits are complemented by indirect evidence of the age of the star that comes from our dynamical and transit timing analyses. We discuss the possibility that future data will provide more concrete constraints on the tidal parameters of TOI-1937Ab and its host star.
